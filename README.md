# RAML for JAX-RS

## Introduction
The goal of RAML for JAX-RS is to provide a set of tools to work with these technologies in a way of being able to scaffold a JAVA + JAX-RS application based on an existing RAML API definition (Code Generation),
or its roundtrip, generate the RAML API definition based on an existing JAVA + JAX-RS application (Documentation).

## Documentation
There are two projects:
- [jaxrs-to-raml](jaxrs-to-raml/README.md); and
- [raml-to-jaxrs](raml-to-jaxrs/README.md).

NOTE: `raml-to-jaxrs` supports both RAML 0.8 and 1.0. `jaxrs-to-raml` supports RAML 1.0 only, to generate RAML 0.8, you can use version `1.3.x` of `raml-for-jax-rs`.
